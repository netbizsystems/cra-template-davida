        <AlertTitle>Responsive Layout Grid</AlertTitle>
        The <a href="https://material-ui.com/components/grid/">MUI</a>&nbsp;
        grid creates visual consistency between layouts while allowing flexibility across a wide variety of device sizes. Material Designâ€™s responsive UI is based on a 12-column grid layout. 
        Apart from being responsive, the <strong>GRID</strong> layout makes it easy to layout a view where things can line up consistantly across various elements on the page.

            Notice the bell icon in the app menu at the top of the page. When an notification is pending your view and action, it will show a ###.
             Clicking that icon will present a dialog offering you context and possible actions that you may want to do. Notifications can be internally 
            generated or they may come from the server.
