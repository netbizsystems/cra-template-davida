# cra-template-davida
Highly opinionated (by DavidA) Template for creating React/Redux/MUI applications

Having a solid starting point using create-react-app is a good start. The davida template extends that basic starting point with things that I want. It is just one of many templates that I will make in my private NPM repository.

## Usage
```bash
npx create-react-app my-davida-app --template davida
```

## Create your own template
Building a React application is a highly opinionated exercise. There are lots of choices to be made and lots of different approaches to take.  Ideally we make them based on knowledge gained from reading, experimentation and experience. I think I can check all three boxes! My mantra has always been, make it work, make it right, make it fast and make it tight. All that in an effort to achieve my two main goals.. quality and productivity. I want to build quality, maintainable applications as quickly as possible.
